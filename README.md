### Understanding the Project folder organisation
 1)Model -> all firebase object and other data related object classses can be defined example (usernmae , password for registration)
 2)Services -> Various logic for services will go in here in seperate dart files so as they can reused in diffent parts of project 
 3)screens -> As the name suggest all individual screens go here (sub folders deine  are used categorisation of pages)+
